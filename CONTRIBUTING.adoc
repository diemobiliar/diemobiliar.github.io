== Install Hugo

Follow the https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/[quick start guide] to get Hugo up and running.

On WP4Dev in WSL2 the easiest way is to install hugo via apt:
[,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hugo
----

Test if hugo works by running: `hugo version`

== Run Hugo

Run hugo in the root directory of the project:

[,bash]
----
hugo server
----

This should start a local server on http://localhost:1313/ and automatically reload the page when you make changes to the source files.

== Create your author page

1. Create a new file in the `content/authors` directory. The name of the file should be your full name (or a username if you prefer). For example `content/authors/firstname-lastname.md`. Check out the existing files for examples. You can add your social media links if you like, only list the ones you want to show up on your page.

2. Add a picture to `assets/images/authors` if you want.
