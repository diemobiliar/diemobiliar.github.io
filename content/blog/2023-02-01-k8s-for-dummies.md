# K8s for dummies

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing and deploying containerized applications.

A container is a lightweight and standalone executable package of software that includes everything needed to run the application, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Kubernetes provides a unified way of managing these containers by automatically scaling, deploying, and managing the containerized applications in a cluster of computers.

With Kubernetes, you can define the desired state of your applications and the platform will automatically ensure that the actual state matches the desired state. This makes it easier to manage and scale your applications, especially as they grow and evolve over time.

Overall, Kubernetes provides a powerful and flexible platform for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale, making it a popular choice for organizations of all sizes.
